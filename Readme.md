2 oportunities were shown for possible seating based on weighting

Table 1 > Her Parents
Table 2 > My Mates
Table 3 > My Parents
Table 4 > Us

Or

Table 1 > Us
Table 2 > Her Parents
Table 3 > My Mates
Table 4 > My Parents

However i prefer the first ones as it keeps my mates as FAR away from the bar as possible



For extra credit i changed

I added a new function

In Class MainHelper.cs
-Line 99 added new function
-Copied Result from FeasibleAssignmentsRanked
-Added extra weighting at line line 103 through 117

The new plan i would have chose post issue

Table 1 > Her Parents
Table 2 > Us
Table 3 > My Parents
Table 4 > My Mates
